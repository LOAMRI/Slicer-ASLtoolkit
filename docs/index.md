![project logo](assets/asltk-logo.png){ width="350" .center}
Welcome to the ASL toolkit!

This 3D Slicer extension was designed to assist users in processing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI images, from basic imaging protocols to the state-of-the-art models provided in the scientific literature.

The major objective of this project is to give an open-source alternative to researchers in the MRI field.

The full documentation of the usage, implementation and updates in the `asltk` library is given in this repository and posted online using a [web-based host](https://asltk.readthedocs.io/en/main/).
